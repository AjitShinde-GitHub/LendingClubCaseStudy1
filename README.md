## Problem Statement
A consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision- 1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. 2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
We have used company provided loan.csv data file for this analysis.
The data given contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default loan, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.



## Business Objective
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## Recommendations
- Lending club should reduce the high interest loans for 60 months tenure, they are prone to loan default
- Grades are good metric for detecting defaulters. Lending club should examine more information from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A)
- Small business loans are defaulted more. Lending club should stop/reduce issuing the loans to them
- Borrowers with mortgage home ownership are taking higher loans and defaulting the approved loans. Lending club should stop giving loans to this category when loan amount requested is more than 12000
- People with more number of public derogatory records are having more chance of filing a bankruptcy. Lending club should make sure there are no public derogatory records for borrower
